## üß† Project Overview

- **Hardware**: The insole includes two 32√ó32 analog multiplexer arrays to capture foot pressure data across 255 points.
- **Data Acquisition**: Data is read using an ESP32E microcontroller and mapped into a 2D grid format.
- **ML Integration**: The captured pressure maps are synchronized with depth camera data for machine learning-based classification.
- **Application**: This system is ideal for gait phase detection, posture evaluation, or medical diagnostics.
